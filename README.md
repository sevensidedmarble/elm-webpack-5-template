<h1>Elm Webpack 5 Template</h1>
</center>

>Want to start a new Elm project with Webpack 5? Here's your starting point.

# Install & Use

```sh
npx degit sevensidedmarble/elm-webpack-5-template elm-project
cd elm-project

npm install
npm run dev
```

# Why

I think reccomending new Elm users to use tools like reactor, and push off thinking about the JS side of your tooling is a big mistake. You should pick frontend tooling that allows your project to easily grow.

# Features you may or may not appreciate

- Webpack 5
- [Degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) is a cool way of bootstrapping projects
- Already setup with some [`Browser.application`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser#application) boilerplate, which I find annoying to write
- Ready to use [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
